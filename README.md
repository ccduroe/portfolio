# My Portfolio 

Welcome! I am Connor Duroe, a recent MS in Bioinformatics Data Science graduate from UD, and this is my portfolio.
This repository showcases my projects in machine learnin and bioinformatics. 

# About Me
- I have a background in chemistry and have worked as an Analytical Chemist
- I am currently working as a Senior Laboratory Technician at the University of Delaware 
- I am seeking opportunities to transition into the world of data science

## Projects

### [Pancreas Cell Type Classification](./projects/pancreas_classification)
**Machine Learning for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis**

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for classifying pancreatic cell types using single-cell RNA sequencing data. Implements multiple ML algorithms including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Deep Neural Networks to perform cross-species classification (mouse to human).

- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Scanpy, SMOTE
- **Key Features:** Cross-species analysis (mouse to human), handling imbalanced datasets, modular architecture
